# Approaching SOLIDJS

I have heard speaking highly about this framework, so I am pretty curious about it and I would like to give it a try. \
So let's do it ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„. \
I will capture and write down some concepts you will surely find [`here`](https://www.solidjs.com/) explained way better but that's just for my studying aim obviously.

***Prerequisites:***
1. [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/): docker daemon for containerization purpose
2. [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/): docker cli
3. [`minikube`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/): in order to apply against local [`kubernetes`](https://kubernetes.io/) environment
4. [`helm`](https://helm.sh/): template engine which enables us to dynamically interpolate value within k8s manifests and install against k8s cluster, relying under the hood on kubectl
5. [`yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq): [`yaml`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) parser

I have created only one `makefile` to perform operation across multiple folder (i.e. different apps) so it is possible to use always [`the same one`](./Makefile) just passing the ENV target, minikube in this case, along with APP which coincides with the application folder we wish to install against the cluster.

**Main makefile targets:** \
Chain and perform all the operation in order to install the declared app:
```bash
make all ENV=minikube APP=my-app-01
```

Clean up the environment (i.e. cluster stop and delete)
```bash
make clean-up ENV=minikube APP=my-app-01
```
